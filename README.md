# Goal

CfK allows us to control resources outside kubernetes. It would be useful to use the capabilities of CfK to create and delete topics and RBAC in a CP outside CfK.

## [cp-demo-example](cp-demo-example/)

Using [cp-demo](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/tutorials/cp-demo/docs/overview.html) we will create a topic, schema and give permissions to an user.
